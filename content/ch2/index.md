# Chapter 2: Integers and Doubles

Numbers are everywhere in programming. A game tracks your score. A banking app calculates interest. A weather service reports temperature. A fitness tracker counts your steps. Behind each of these is a program working with numeric data.

But not all numbers are the same. Some are whole: 42 points, 7 items in your cart, 3 login attempts. Others have decimal parts: 98.6 degrees, $19.99, a 3.75 GPA. This distinction matters because computers store these two kinds of numbers differently, and choosing the wrong one causes problems.

This chapter introduces C#'s two main numeric types: integers for whole numbers and doubles for decimals. We will start by understanding what these types are and how C# stores them. Then we will learn to compute with them, combining and transforming numeric values. By the end, we will connect numbers back to the boolean logic from Chapter 1, using numeric comparisons to control program behavior.

## Chapter Sections

1. **[Data and Memory](ch2-1.md):** How C# represents numbers and how we store them
2. **[Computation](ch2-2.md):** How we transform numeric values through arithmetic and comparison

We begin with a fundamental question: how does C# represent numbers?
